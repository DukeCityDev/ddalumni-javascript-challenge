# ddalumni-javascript-challenge

## Directions 

>Choose from the following JavaScript Challenge Questions and Solve the Problem. You can choose any of the following, adding up to seven points. You have one hour to implement your solution, and push your code back to this repository, under the /answers directory.

## The Rules
1. Don't cheat. If you're cheating, someone else isn't having fun. You can Google whatever you would like, but be prepared to defend your code, and please don't copy and paste. That's really it.
2. No use of frameworks. For this challenge, let's stick to vanilla JavaScript and, if you need it for challenge section 3, HTML and CSS. 

### Challenge Questions

1. .75 points each (maximum 2 challenges allowed)
 - Given two strings, return true if they are anagrams of one another. Like elbow and below...
 - FizzBuzz! Create a loop that iterates up to 100 and outputs fizz, buzz, and fizzbuzz on certain numbers and their multiples. 
 - Write a function that returns the factorial of a number.

2. 2 points each
 - Make an HTTP request and display data to the console. 
 - Given an array of integers, find the index(n) where the sum of the integers to the left of n is equal to the sum of integers to the right of n, and if there is no index that would make this happen, return false. For instance: `let arr = [1,2,3,4,3,2,1]` would return `3`, because the sum of the array on either side of the 4 is 6.
 - Build a unit conversion application that accepts user input and outputs the conversion to the console or to the DOM.

3. 4 points 
 - Full Stack JavaScript! Build and application with a working "front-end" and "back-end" HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only!
